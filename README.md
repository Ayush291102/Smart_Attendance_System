Welcome to the Smart Attendance System Project created using openCV

First of all ypu need to import the following packages to your system-
1. openCV
2. numpy
3. os
4. csv
5. face_recognition
6. datetime

"Note :- Make sure to install Visual Studio for C++ to ensure installation of all required packages"

This program detects the face of the person in the camera and matches it with the datasets to recognize the individual.

If it matches their name gets removed from the array and gets added to a separate excel sheet with time of arrival.

This program is helpful for hassle-free attendance in classrooms.
